## Race Traits ##


The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of most races. 

### Age 
  
  The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. 
  
## size##

Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Large (between 8 and 12 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. 

## Variant##

Some races have variants. You can choose the variant version of the race at 1st level when creating your character and you gain any new traits associated with it. If there are two traits with the same name, the variant version takes precedence.


# Human 

“Humans are the dominant species of Earth. In the post–apocalyptic age, "human" is more specifically used to denote those that have been more-or-less unaffected by radiation as opposed to mutants like ghouls and super mutants, even though said mutant types originate from humans. Non–mutated humans are sometimes called normals, smoothskins, humies, or bleeders by their mutant counterparts. Despite the existence of various mutations, humans are still the most common humanoid creatures on Earth. Post-nuclear humans, as a direct result of the radiation and exposition to the Forced Evolutionary Virus and some other biochemical agents released into the environment during and after the Great War, exhibit more diversity, primarily in genetic structure. The aforementioned factors have resulted in an increased rate of mutations in humans, although very few of these result in phenotypic changes. Most of these changes are non-lethal, non-damaging variations in the human DNA that simply increase the gene pool variety. Also, humans with minor mutations, like additional toes, skin lesions due to TDC infection, permanent red eyes, permanent varicose veins, or complete lack of hair are still considered to be humans.

**Age**
Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century. Though, those who live this long are far and few between in the wasteland. 

**Size** 
Humans vary widely in height and build, your size is Medium or Small. 

### **Variant Human Traits** 

If your GM allows it, you can optionally start with these variant abilities.

*Resourceful* 
You gain one extra Karma Cap that you can use each game. 

*Unexposed* 
You have disadvantage on all Radiation and Addiction checks. 

**Variant: Gen 3 Synth.** 
Oftentimes, Humans in the wasteland are actually synthetic machines that are indistinguishable from a regular human created by a secret cabal of scientists called “The Institute”. This variant option provides no abilities or statistical change. However it can provide a psychological or narrative one. Work with your GM on how this potentiality could affect your character. Alternatively, when creating your human character; roll a d20. On a 20, your character is secretly a Gen 3 Synth.

# Ghoul 

Ghouls are mutated humans affected by the phenomenon of ghoulification. Despite their zombie-like appearance, the flesh of ghouls is not actually rotten. Intense and prolonged radiation has ravaged their skin, much of their flesh, and in some cases many of their ligaments. Despite their infertility and in some cases mental deterioration, they have greatly extended overall lifespans and are immune to (and sometimes even healed by) background radiation and/or nuclear fallout.

Ghouls typically can live well in human societies, but they are nevertheless a minority. There do exist Ghoul communities and cities. The Necropolis was once one, before it was partially destroyed by Super Mutants. Many pre-war farming cities in California including Broken Hills, Dayglow, and Gecko. 

Due to their near immortal lifespan, Ghouls often take on entire new personas every century or so. They learn new skills and inherit an entirely different identity until moving on to the next.

**Age**
Ghouls are nearly immortal, their lifespan is unknown. Some Ghouls have survived from even before the Great War over 200 years ago.

**Size** 
Ghouls vary widely in height and build, your size is Medium or Small.

**Evolution**
You cannot gain levels of radiation and you are immune to radiation damage. Additionally, you gain no Irradiated levels from consuming food or water.

**Resilient Anatomy**

You are resistant to poison damage. Any stamina points you would gain from consuming food, drinks, or chems is halved (rounded down). Any hit points you would gain from stimpaks is halved (rounded down). You cannot gain hit points from healing powder. Syringes that aren’t ‘loaders’ have no effect on you. Additionally, whenever you take damage from the bleeding condition, you take half as much.

### **Variant Ghoul Traits** 

If your GM allows it, you can optionally start with these variant abilities.

*Many Roads Walked* 
You gain a +2 in all skills and you gain an extra perk at 1st Level. 

*Old Bones*
You are immune to poison damage and you gain the Stitched Together perk. 

*Half Life*
Your mind slips each day, ghoulification has taken an immense toll on you and you feel yourself slowly becoming feral. When you reach Level 15, you are fully consumed by ghoulification, your mind is no longer your own, and your character is controlled by the GM

# Gen-2 Synth 

Synth (short for synthetic humanoids, also called androids or artificial humans) is a common term used to refer to biological and mechanical robots manufactured within the Institute laboratories. Synths in extremely rare cases can escape the clutches of the Institute and live their own lives. Sometimes even having their memory erased and filled with new ones to live out their lives. Gen 2 Synths however are a different story, they are much more clear to be androids with plastic like skin, exposed insides, and metal pieces. The most common variant of mechanical synth. Gen-2s still possess limited A.I. and superficially resemble a mannequin more than a human.

**Age**
Gen-2 Synths can live hundreds of years before their inorganic materials begin to corrode and their programming deteriorates. However, a Synth who keeps consistent repairs is nigh immortal.

**Size** 
Gen-2 Synths vary widely in height and build, your size is Medium or Small.

**Inorganic Body**
You are immune to radiation and poison. You gain no effects from Chems, Drinks or Food. Additionally you have no need to breathe, sleep, eat, or drink.

### **Variant Gen-2 Synth Traits** 

If your GM allows it, you can optionally start with these variant abilities.

*Brittle Body* 
Whenever a creature makes a targeted attack against you, you gain two limb conditions instead of one. Additionally you are vulnerable to electricity damage. 

*Software and Hardware Upgrades*
Whenever you gain a perk, you are considered a Robot for perk requirements.

*Artificial Intelligence Algorithms*
Whenever you gain skill points, you gain 1 more.

# Robots 

“A robot is a machine that is capable of autonomously completing tasks. Depending upon the robot, these tasks may be simple or complex and may require little human intervention or complete oversight. Robots had been constructed by pre-War society to fill all niches and occupations. From general-purpose utility droids to full-fledged military battle machines, robots could be found in almost any environment and function. Some of the robots in the Fallout universe will attack immediately but some will aid in battle or remain ambivalent

**Age**
Robots can live hundreds of years before their inorganic materials begin to corrode and their programming deteriorates. However, a Robot who keeps consistent repairs is nigh immortal.

**Inorganic Body**
You cannot gain radiation levels, you are immune to radiation damage and poison damage. You cannot gain levels of bleeding. You gain no effects from Chems, Drinks or Food. Additionally, you have no need to breathe, sleep, eat, or drink.

**Size** 
While there are many types of Robots, most were built to maintain a similar size to humans. Handy’s are about 2 and a half feet to 3 and a half feet in height but hover 2 to 3 feet off the ground. Protectrons rarely were built taller than 5 feet. And Robobrains typically sit around 5 and a half feet. Regardless, your size is medium.

**Evolution**
You cannot gain levels of radiation and you are immune to radiation damage. Additionally, you gain no Irradiated levels from consuming food or water.

**Severed Limbs**

Luckily for most robots, reattaching limbs is commonplace when they break or fall off. If any of your limbs are severed, you do not go into shock and they can be reattached with 3 steel and 1 circuitry junk item. When you or a creature reattaches a limb, it takes a number of minutes equal to 10- their or your crafting skill bonus. If the amount of time is reduced to 0, it takes 6 AP to reattach the limb instead.

**Armor and Weapons**
You can use armor and weapons just as any other race would. If your robot sub-type grants you a weapon, you can upgrade and modify this weapon just like any other weapon. However, you cannot use power armor.

## **Robot Type** 

There are three types of robot that you can choose from. Handy, Protectron, and Robobrain.

### Handy 

The Handy robot is a maintenance and construction robot with multiple, multi-jointed appendages, which levitates thanks to its powerful jet-powered engine. They were generally in use as butlers, maintenance workers and sometimes also employed as guards before the Great War.

While oftentimes their name suggests a gender role, “Mister Handy” or “Miss Handy” is simply a name to describe the robot's model. Handy’s have multitudes of voices, personalities, and names and can present themselves as any gender.
