Requirements: Strength 6

If you spend your action points to move at least 15 feet in a straight line, your next unarmed or melee weapon attack has advantage. If this attack hits and deals damage to the creature's hit points, you may choose for the target to either fall prone or be knocked back a number of feet equal to 5 x your Strength ability modifier.
