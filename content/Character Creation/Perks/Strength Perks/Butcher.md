Requirements: Strength 5

You’re hackin’, whackin’, and choppin’ that meat! Whenever you roll damage from an attack roll made with a melee weapon, add 2 to the result. Additionally, if you make a targeted attack with a bladed melee weapon to a creature's arms or legs and deal more than double their level in points of damage to the creature's hit points, you sever the limb!
