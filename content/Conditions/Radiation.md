Whenever you roll a d20, the total is subtracted by 1 for each level of radiation you have. Additionally, each time you gain a level of radiation you take 1d12 radiation damage to your hit points. This damage cannot be healed until you are no longer in an irradiated zone. If this radiation damage reduces you to 0 hit points, or you would gain your 10th level of radiation; you die. Roll a Luck check with a DC of 20. If you succeed, you return to life as a ghoul with 1 hit point. If you roll below a 5 on this check, you instead return to life as a feral ghoul and the GM controls your character
