You can spend 3 additional AP when you attack with a weapon that has this property to also target two additional areas with the attack roll. These areas are as long as the weapons range and must be within 5 feet of the previously targeted area. Each creature or object in the area is attacked with the attack roll and takes damage if the attack beats their AC. If a single creature occupies both or all the areas, they are targeted by each attack; taking damage from all the attack rolls. If the weapon specifies it “always cleaves”, you do not have to spend the additional AP to make this special attack
