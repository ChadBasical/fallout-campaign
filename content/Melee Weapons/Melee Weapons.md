Melee weapons range from a shiv, to a baton, to the powerful super sledge, to the mechanical ripper. Anything you can hold in your hands and swing, jab, or whack with is a melee weapon. The table below lists many melee weapons used in the wasteland, but you can always re-flavor a melee weapon to something else if you like the statistics. There are four types of melee weapons; bladed, blunt, mechanical, and unarmed. They are divided into different tables below. If a perk, ability, or modification only operates with a certain type of melee weapon, reference which table it is under for its type. 

**Attacking** 
To attack a target with a melee weapon, you must spend the appropriate action points listed in the weapons table. When you attack a target with a melee weapon, you must beat their AC in order to deal damage. Roll a d20 and add your melee weapons skill bonus. If your roll’s total is equal to or greater than the target’s AC, you deal damage. 

**Action Points**
(Abbreviated to AP) How many action points you must spend on your turn to attack with the weapon. The fewer the action points, the lighter and quicker the weapon is. 

**Damage**
When you attack with a melee weapon and beat the AC of your target, you deal damage to the target equal to the dice roll plus your Strength ability modifier. If your modifier is negative and reduces the damage to 0, you deal 1 damage instead. 

**Range**
All melee weapons have a range of 5 feet unless otherwise specified. 

**Critical Hit Chance and Type**
When you make an attack roll with a melee weapon and the result of the roll is equal to or higher than the number listed under in the critical hit section, you deal extra damage equal to the dice or modifier in the critical hit section. If an “x” is listed, this means the damage you deal is multiplied by the number next to the x. (Example: you attack with a knife and roll a 20, you roll a 4 on the 1d6 damage dice and add your +2 Strength modifier for a total of 6. The critical hit modifier is x3, so the critical hit damage is multiplied by 3 for a total of 18 damage.) 

**Special Properties**
Some melee weapons have special abilities or conditions that apply when you attack or provide alternate ways to attack. Each one varies and should be read before wielding the weapon. Some have keywords which are detailed below under Melee Weapon Special Properties. 

**Carry Load and Strength Requirement**
A representation of how heavy the weapon is, and how much space it takes up. If you attack with a melee weapon you do not meet the Strength requirement for; you have disadvantage on the attack roll unless you spend an additional 2 AP to attack with the weapon. 

**Decay**
All melee weapons gain a level of [[decay]] when you roll a 1 on an attack roll or if you throw a melee weapon that doesn't have the thrown property.
