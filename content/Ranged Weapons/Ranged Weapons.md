**Attacking**
To attack a target with a ranged weapon, you must spend the appropriate action points listed in the weapons table. When you attack a target with a ranged weapon, you must beat their AC in order to deal damage. Roll a d20 and add your Guns skill bonus. If your roll’s total is equal to or greater than the target’s AC, you deal damage. 

**Action Points**
(Abbreviated to AP) How many action points you must spend on your turn to attack with the weapon. Ranged weapons with fewer action points are often lighter, easier to use, or fire quickly. 

**Damage**
When you attack with a ranged weapon and beat the AC of your target, you deal damage to the target equal to the dice roll plus your Agility ability modifier. If your modifier is negative and reduces the damage to 0, you deal 1 damage instead. 

**Range**
Ranged weapons each have a different range specified in the weapon tables below. To calculate a weapons range, multiply your Perception ability score by the numbers listed in the Range column. The first number is the weapons short range, and the second number is the weapons long range. You have disadvantage on attack rolls against targets who are beyond the short range of the weapon. Attack rolls against targets beyond the long range of the weapon only hit if you roll a 20. 

**Critical Hit Chance and Type**
When you make an attack roll with a ranged weapon and the result of the roll is equal to or higher than the number listed under in the critical hit section, you deal extra damage equal to the dice or modifier in the critical hit section. If an “x” is listed, this means the damage you deal is multiplied by the number next to the x. (Example: you attack with a knife and roll a 20, you roll a 4 on the 1d6 damage dice and add your +2 Strength modifier for a total of 6. The critical modifier is x3, so the critical damage is multiplied by 3 for a total of 18 damage.) 

**Ammo and Reload**
Each ranged weapon requires [[ammunition]] of some kind to allow it to fire. You can attack with a ranged weapon so long as you have rounds available in the weapon. To load rounds into the weapon, you must have the required ammunition and you must spend 6 AP to reload. 

**Special Properties**
Some ranged weapons have special abilities or conditions that apply when you attack or provide alternate ways to attack. Each one varies and should be read before wielding the weapon. Some have keywords which are detailed below under [[Ranged Weapon Special Properties]]. 

**Carry Load and Strength Requirement**
A representation of how heavy the weapon is, the amount of Strength you need to sustain the kickback, and how much space it takes up. If you attack with a ranged weapon you do not meet the Strength requirement for; you have disadvantage on the attack roll unless you wield the weapon with two hands and spend an additional 2 AP to attack with the weapon. 

**Decay**
All ranged weapons gain a level of [[decay]] when you reload it for the tenth time and when you roll a 1 on an attack roll unless otherwise specified.
