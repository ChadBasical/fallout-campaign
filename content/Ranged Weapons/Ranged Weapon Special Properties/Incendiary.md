When you deal damage to a target creature’s hit points with a weapon that has this property, they gain the [[Burning ]]condition. If an attack with a ranged weapon with this property misses, the projectile may land nearby and alight any flammable objects (up to GM’s discretion). Additionally, any flammable objects hit by a weapon with this property immediately burst into [[flames]].
