If you spend AP to attack with this weapon directly after spending AP to attack with it on the same turn, you can make another attack without spending any AP. (Example: If you spend 4 AP to attack with a Laser Pistol on your turn, then you immediately spend 4 AP to attack again with the Laser Pistol, you can attack again without spending any AP.)
