Unless it results in death, damage to Stamina and Hit points isn’t permanent. Rest can restore a creature’s hit points (as explained on page 76 and 77) and more extreme methods like a first aid kit or stimpak can heal even quicker. 

## Dropping to 0 Hit Points
When you drop to 0 hit points, you lose all of your stamina points (if you had any) and either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections. Severe Injuries. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you take a severe injury if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum. For example, a ghoul with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack and is reduced to 0 hit points, 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the ghoul loses an arm! 

## Instant Death
Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage equal to three times your hit point maximum reduces you to 0 hit points, you instantly die. 

## Death Saves
When your character takes enough damage to reduce their hit points to 0, they gain the dying condition. When you gain the dying condition, you fall prone, your AP is reduced to 0, at the start of each of your turns you gain 4 AP, you recycle all of your unspent points at the start of your turn, and you cannot have more than 6 AP during your turn. At the beginning of each of your turns, you can spend 2 AP to make a Death Save with a DC of 10. When you make a Death Save; you roll a d20 and add your Luck or Endurance modifier, and you add your Party Nerve bonus. If you do not make a Death Save at the beginning of your turn, you automatically fail it. If you succeed 3 Death Saves, you gain 1 hit point. If you fail 3 Death Saves, you die. 

## Rolling 1 or 20
When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point. 

## Damage at 0 Hit Points
If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death. 

## Stabilizing a Creature
The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death saving throw. You can use 6 AP to administer first aid to a dying creature, roll a Medicine skill check with the DC equal to 10 - the creature's Endurance modifier. On a success, the creature returns to 1 hit point. 

## Enemies and Death
Most GMs have an enemy die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws. Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters. 

## Knocking a Creature Out 
Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious for a number of hours equal to 1d4 - their Endurance modifier to a minimum of 1.

## Temporary Stamina Points and Hit Points

Some consumables and perks grant temporary stamina points or temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary stamina or hit points are a representation of having an edge in combat, it is your character's resilience pushing beyond their limit. When you have temporary stamina points or temporary hit points and you take damage, the temporary stamina points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your stamina points if you have any. Then, if your stamina points are equal to 0, then your temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your hit points if you have any. A character can, therefore, be at full stamina point or hit points and receive temporary stamina points or temporary hit points. Healing can’t restore temporary stamina or hit points, and they can’t be added together. If you have temporary stamina or hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a perk grants you 12 temporary stamina points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22. The same goes for hit points. Some items and perks require dealing damage to a creature’s hit points, thus; any damage dealt to temporary hit points is as if the damage was dealt to the creature's hit points. If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary stamina or hit points doesn’t bring you out of the dying condition or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you’re in that state. Unless a consumable, item, perk, or ability that grants you temporary stamina or hit points has a duration, they last until they’re depleted or if you finish a rest that was at least 1 hour.
