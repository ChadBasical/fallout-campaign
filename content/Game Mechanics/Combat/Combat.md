When tensions rise, your survival can come down to even the smallest actions. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls combat sequence. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other. 

## Combat Step by Step
1. Determine surprise. The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised. 
2. Establish positions. The GM decides where everyone is located.
3. Roll combat sequence. Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls a combat sequence, determining the order of combatants º turns. 
4. Take turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in combat sequence order. 
5. Begin the next round. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops
