Every creature has Action Points (abbreviated to AP) that quantify what they can do on a turn. A creature’s AP total is equal to 10 + their Agility modifier. On your turn, you can spend AP to perform certain actions in combat. Every type of action has an AP cost typically between 3 and 6 points. The most common actions you can take are described in the “Actions in Combat” section. If you want to take an action that isn’t specifically listed in the Actions in Combat section, describe what you would like your character to do and the GM may decide how many action points it costs to complete the action. If you need assistance in deciding how many points an improvised action would need, use the guide below. 

Action Points are a *representation* on how quickly or slowly an action is to take. They may be influenced but do not equivocate to real seconds or time. Liberties have to be taken in the game space to allow fairness in combat. Something might take half a second to do in the real world, but may cost 3 AP in the game for the sake of balance. However, you can use the guide below on how to determine the speed of an action in combat. 

## 1 AP
Faster than eyes can process, or just simultaneous with other actions. It is extremely rare for an improvised action to only cost a single point. These actions are often relegated to very small split second “hand wave” actions, or actions you can take at the same time as others. 5 feet of movement, pressing a button without timing it, or any action that would have your body acting quicker than your mind in a split second. There are some abilities in the game that reduce a cost to a single action point, which is an indicator that your character is extremely quick at performing said action. 

## 2 AP
Still faster than your neurons can fire off. Similar to 1 AP, extremely rare for improvised actions. In fact, likely rarer. 2 AP typically acts as an additional modifier to some actions to make them slower or more deliberate. There 128 isn’t much of a difference from an action costing 1 AP to 2 AP except for petty meticulousness. 

## 3 AP
As fast as possible. 3 AP is the soft limit on speed for improvised actions in this system. Opening a door, throwing a small object, making an active perception check to find something in the area. You’ve got to think, execute, and respond. If you want to do something quick, chances are it costs 3 AP. 

## 4 AP
Real quick. 4 AP is only slightly slower than as fast as possible. Maybe the weapon’s a little finicky or heavy. Maybe you need to spend extra time to aim. 4 AP isn’t too different from 3 AP, but it complicates things. Throwing a slightly heavier object, opening a rusty door, making a perception check to find something in a very disorienting room. 

## 5 AP
Medium speed. You're still operating as quickly as you can, but whatever you’re doing is a hassle. Your weapon might be cumbersome or janky. A door might be busted, the object you're trying to throw is weighted to one side, or you're trying to throw something really far. Either way, this is the middle ground when it comes to speed. 

## 6 AP
Slow. The action you're performing requires a lot of thought, movement, strength, or precision to execute. 6 AP acts as the soft cap for any single action. Actions that cost more than 6 AP are often special abilities that optionally allow you to spend more than 6 AP. Any improvised action that costs more than 6 AP should only be for handling heavier weapons in a special way, or performing extremely slow, dramatic, and daunting actions. Such as binding a fusion reaction with your bare hands, making a final jump onto a ledge from an impossible distance, or doing everything in your power to try and hit a target. In these instances, the GM may agree if the action you want to try and execute is fitting for the game, but should typically ask you to “use all of your action points to attempt this”. 

## Recycling Action Points
If you don’t use all your AP on your turn, you can recycle half of them for your next turn! Example: You have 10 AP. You move 30 feet on your turn which costs 6 AP, leaving 4 left over. On your next turn you will gain 2 extra AP and have a total of 12 AP
