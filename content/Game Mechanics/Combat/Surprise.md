Raiders sneak up on a pack of ghouls, springing from the ruins to attack them. A super mutant stalks down a vault passage, unnoticed by the characters until the mutant pummels them with a super sledge. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other. The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Sneak checks of anyone hiding with the passive sense score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or creature that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter. If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.
