On your turn you can spend action points to make an attack. When you make an attack you choose a target within range, then roll a d20 with the skill associated with the weapon you’re using. If your roll total is greater than your target’s AC, you roll and deal damage. 

### Unarmed and Melee Weapon Attacks
Unarmed attacks cost 3 AP. They deal 1d4 + STR or AGI Mod bludgeoning damage. 

### Blocking
While unarmed or wielding a melee weapon, you can spend 3 AP to block. Blocking increases your damage threshold by 2 + your Endurance modifier against other melee attacks. Your block lasts until you attack again. 

### Critical Hit
All weapons have a critical hit chance listed in the weapon’s table. When you make an attack roll with a weapon and the result of the d20, without adding any modifiers, is equal to or higher than the critical hit chance; the attack automatically hits and deals extra damage. Each weapon’s critical hit damage is different and listed in the weapon’s table. All weapons you attack with (besides 130 shotguns) have their critical hit chance lowered by a number equal to half your Luck modifier. 

### Critical Failure
When you make an attack roll with a weapon and the result of the d20 is a 1, you automatically miss and the weapon you attacked with gains one level of decay. 

### Sneak Attacks
If an enemy cannot sense you (being invisible, heavily obscured, full cover) and are unaware of your presence. Your attacks are critical hits and ignore Stamina Points. However you still must roll attack and beat the target's AC. 

### Blind Attack
If you are blinded, or your target is heavily obscured but not behind total cover, any attack you make against them is a blind attack. When you make a blind attack, you add your Luck ability modifier to your roll instead of your normal modifier. Instead of beating your target’s AC, your Luck ability check must beat the blind attack DC. The DC is equal to 5 + the amount of feet your target is away from you, rounded down in increments of 5. 

## Targeted Attacks

You make a special kind of attack that target’s a creature's appendages and limbs for unique effects. 

### Making a targeted attack
On your turn, you can choose to make a targeted attack. When you do, choose a limb on a target creature within range to attack. Depending on the limb, you will need to spend additional AP to make a targeted attack to that limb. The amount of additional AP you must spend is listed on the table below. If the attack hits, apply the effects to the damage dealt listed in the effects column of the table below. If this damage is dealt to the target creature’s hit points, roll a d4 and determine the associated condition with the number you rolled. The target is inflicted by the condition you roll. You can re-roll this d4 a number of times equal to your Luck ability modifier. 

### Critical Hit
If your targeted attack critically hits, you inflict a severe injury based on the limb you targeted. Alternatively, instead of inflicting a severe injury you can choose up to two of the conditions to inflict upon the target. 

### Melee weapons
If you make a targeted attack with a melee weapon, the additional AP required to make the attack is reduced by 2 to a minimum of 1. 

### Eye Gouged
The target’s Perception ability score is reduced by 2. If both eyes are gouged, the target creature is permanently blinded. (But can take the [[Blind Devil]] perk!) 

### Concussion
The target has three permanent levels of exhaustion for a number of days equal to the target’s Endurance ability score - 10 (to a minimum of 1). 

### Broken Arm 
The target has disadvantage on any ability check, skill check, or attack roll that uses Strength or Agility that require two arms. This condition can be removed with a doctor’s bag. 

### Severed Arm/Hand
The target loses a hand if their Luck score is equal to 6 or higher. The target loses an arm if their Luck score is equal to 5 or lower. If the target loses their hand: they go into [[shock]], gain two levels of [[bleeding]], and their Agility ability score is reduced by 2. If the target loses their arm: they go into shock, gain four levels of bleeding, and their Agility ability score is reduced by 2 and their Strength ability score is reduced by 2. (But can take the [[Adaptive Reflexes]] perk!) 

### Rattled
The target becomes [[frightened]] for 3 turns. 

### Sliced Jugular
The target gains four levels of bleeding and gains two at the start of each of their turns until all levels of [[bleeding]] are healed. 

### Temporary Blindness
The target becomes blinded for the next hour or until all of their hit points are healed. 

### Internal Bleeding
The target gains one level of bleeding and gains one at the start of each of their turns until all levels of bleeding are healed. 

### Intense Agony
The target goes into shock and is [[dazed]] for 2 turns. 

### Severed Leg/Foot 
The target loses a foot if their Luck score is equal to 6 or higher. The target loses their leg if their Luck score is equal to 5 or lower. If the target loses their foot: they go into [[shock]], gain two levels of[[ bleeding]], and their Agility ability score is reduced by 2. If the target loses their leg: they go into shock, gain four levels of bleeding, and their Agility ability score is reduced by 2 and their Strength ability score is reduced by 2. (But can take the [[Adaptive Reflexes]] perk!) Additionally, a creature who loses their foot or leg can only move a maximum of 20 feet on a turn. If the target loses all of their feet or legs, they fall prone and their only movement option is to crawl. 

### Gut Wallop
The target becomes [[dazed]] for the next 2 turns. 

### Painful Collapse
The target falls [[prone]] and becomes [[dazed ]]until the end of their next turn. 

## Leg Cripple
