Combat sequence determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Perception check to determine their place in the combat sequence order. The GM makes either one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, rolls individually for each creature, or pre-determines the creature's combat sequence by choice or by passive initiative scores (10 + the creature's Perception ability modifier). The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Perception check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the combat sequence order) in which they act during each round. The combat sequence order remains the same from round to round. If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a creature and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and creatures each roll a Luck check to determine the order, highest roll going first.
