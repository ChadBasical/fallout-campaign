Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who live in the wasteland. The jab of a knife, the impact of a bullet, the burning of a laser, or the blast from a grenade can injure, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures. 

Every character has Stamina points and Hit points. Your hit points are a measurement of your bodily health and willpower. Whenever you take damage, you first subtract that damage from your Stamina Points. Though damage taken from stamina points is not in many ways considered bodily harm, but a near graze, a dodged blow, or a quick juke. Some abilities may require you to physically damage your opponent, in which you must damage their Hit Points. 

## Stamina Points 
Stamina Points are a measurement of your exhaustion, dodging abilities, and fortitude. Dodging a near life ending bullet is harrowing, sometimes you can shrug off a punch, but as battle continues you grow weary and thus your stamina points drain. Stamina Points are a combination of exhaustion, fortitude, and your acrobatic abilities. Whenever a creature takes damage, and can see or is otherwise aware of the damage; the damage is subtracted from their stamina points. When your stamina points drop to 0, damage is subsequently subtracted from your Hit Points. 

## Hit Points 
Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Whenever a creature takes damage and has no stamina points, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. Creatures also take damage to their hit points if they are unconscious, unaware of their surroundings, or otherwise incapable of moving. 

### Damage Rolls 
Each weapon, explosive, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage. 

When attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to the damage. (For example, when you attack with a 10mm pistol, you use your Guns skill to hit. The Guns skill uses Agility. Therefore, when you deal damage; you add your agility modifier to the total damage roll.) If a weapon, explosive, or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them.

### Critical Hits
When you score a critical hit, you deal extra damage equal to the modifier listed in the weapons crit column. 

## Damage Types

Different attacks, weapons, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types. The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect. 

### Acid
A volatile formula concocted in a lab that blasts out of an experimental gun, or the excretion from a powerful wasteland mutant all deal acid damage. 

### Bludgeoning
Blunt force attacks — a pipe, falling, constriction, and the like — deal bludgeoning damage. 

### Ballistic
The varying sizes of all kinds of bullets that blast from firearms deals ballistic damage. 

### Cold
The freezing burn of cryogenic weapons deals cold damage. 

### Electricity
A damaged wire, taser, or blast from an EMP deals electricity damage. 

### Explosive
The combination of shrapnel and concussive force creates explosive damage. 

### Fire
Flamers or molotov cocktails burn their victims with fire damage. 

### Impact
Bludgeoning on a much larger scale. Falling, being thrown, or something heavy falling on you are all types of impact damage. 

### Laser
The concentrated beam of coherent light that precisely burns from a laser weapon deals laser damage. 

### Plasma
The often slow and superheated bolts of green plasma that blast from plasma weapons, melting all in its path, deal plasma damage. 

### Piercing
Puncturing and impaling attacks, including knives and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage. 

### Poison
Venomous stings from various wasteland creatures deal poison damage. 

### Slashing
Blades, axes, knives, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage. 

### Damage Resistance and Vulnerability 
Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage. If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it (rounded down). If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

### The Order of Damage 

There are lots of ways damage can be increased or reduced in this system. Below is an listed order of when to apply various resistances and damage thresholds when a creature takes damage. 

When a creature takes damage, it is first subtracted from their temporary stamina points, then their stamina points. If a creature has no temporary stamina points, and has no stamina points, then the damage is reduced by half if they have resistance, or doubled if they are vulnerable to the damage, then it is subtracted by their DT. Any damage after this is carried over and first subtracted by the creature’s temporary hit points, then their hit points. If a creature ever heals their stamina points, or temporary stamina points; the next time they take damage it is subtracted from their stamina points again.

Temporary Stamina Points -> Stamina Points -> Resistance/Vulnerability -> Damage Threshold (DT) -> Temporary Hit Points -> Hit Points.
