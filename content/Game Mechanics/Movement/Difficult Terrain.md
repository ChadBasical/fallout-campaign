The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or deserts. But wastelanders often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground â€” all considered difficult terrain. 

Creatures can only move up to a maximum of 20 feet on a turn in difficult terrain during combat. When traveling, the distance traveled is halved.

Terrain such as sharp piles of rubble, unstable floating objects, flimsy boards spanning a drop, or waist high sludge are all examples of extreme difficult terrain. Creature can only move up to a maximum of 10 feet on a turn in extreme difficult terrain during combat. When traveling, the distance traveled is quartered.
