While traveling long distances, the characters can choose to move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown in the table below. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive and prone to ambush, while a slow pace makes it possible to scout, sneak, and remain alert. 

## Traveling Limits
Each character can travel a number of hours equal to 8 + half their endurance modifier (rounded down). For each hour traveled beyond their maximum, characters gain one additional level of fatigue. 

## The Roads Walked
Walking on foot across the wasteland is an arduous and difficult task. Many don’t survive let alone are at their best after walking all day. Regardless of pace or how long the characters walk, each character gains a level of fatigue when they travel on foot for at least half their maximum distance (rounded down). 

## Passive Sneak
Depending on the character's speed while traveling, they can move through the wasteland unnoticed. Consult the table below on the character's passive sneak which is determined by their speed. Creatures whose passive sense is lower than their score cannot detect the party while they travel unless (to GM’s discretion) the party blows their cover by entering combat, making lots of noise, or becoming obvious to their surroundings. 

## Vehicles and Mounts
Characters who ride in a caravan, on the back of a beast, or drive a vehicle have the luxury of not becoming fatigued at the end of their journey and can potentially travel even further distances. If a character is riding a mount, they use the mount's maximum travel distance instead of their own and gain no levels of fatigue for traveling. For short spans of time (up to an hour), some mounts can move swiftly. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. However, their mount gains one level of fatigue. If the character is driving a vehicle, they gain no levels of fatigue for traveling half their maximum distance and their maximum travel distance is doubled. This does not apply to any characters riding in a vehicle that they are not driving.
