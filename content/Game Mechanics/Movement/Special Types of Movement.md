These rules detail more specific types of movement outside of simply walking. 

## Climbing
You can spend AP on your turn to climb vertical surfaces. While you are climbing, you are considered off-balance. 

While in combat sequence, you have a limit to how many rounds you can continue to climb. You can continue climbing on each of your turns for a number of rounds equal to your Endurance ability score (to a minimum of one round). At the start of your next turn after climbing past your limit, you fall. 

Before you climb, the GM ranks the vertical surface between Scalable, Sheer, or Treacherous. Each of which determines how much AP it costs to climb 5 feet. If you have climbing gear such as ropes or stakes; you use 1 less AP to climb 5 feet (except for treacherous surfaces where climbing equipment is required). 

### Scalable
Scalable surfaces either have handholds, aren’t perfectly vertical, are rugged, or are otherwise easy to climb. Rocky cliffs, brick walls, an askew ruin, or a large tree are examples of Scalable surfaces. On your turn in combat sequence, you can spend 3 AP to climb 5 feet up a scalable surface. 

### Sheer 
Sheer surfaces either have very few handholds, are smoother, slippery, more vertical, or are otherwise difficult to climb without equipment. An intact building, a smooth stone cliff face, rain pouring over a normally scalable wall, or a cave wall that turns outwards are examples of sheer surfaces. On your turn in combat sequence, you can spend 4 AP to climb 5 feet up a sheer surface. 

### Treacherous 
Treacherous surfaces either have no handholds, are perfectly vertical, made of a slippery material, or are otherwise impossible to climb without equipment. The interior metal wall of a vault, a smooth stone cliff face that slants outwards, or the concrete exterior of a building with no handholds are all examples of Treacherous surfaces. You cannot climb a treacherous surface without climbing equipment of some kind. On your turn in combat sequence, you can spend 4 AP with climbing equipment to climb 5 feet up a treacherous surface. 

## Swimming

You can spend AP on your turn to swim. While you are swimming, you are considered off-balance. Before you swim, the GM ranks how hazardous the body water is between Still, Rushing, or Hazardous. Each of which determines how much AP it costs to swim 5 feet. 

### Diving
You can spend AP on your turn to dive into the water you are swimming in. Swimming while underwater requires 1 more AP to move 5 feet. You can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + your Endurance ability modifier (minimum of 30 seconds). The amount of time you can hold your breath reduces by 30 seconds (6 rounds) each time you take damage or use more than half your AP on your turn. If you cannot hold your breath any longer and are still underwater, you begin drowning ([[Suffocating]]). 

### Still Waters
Still waters either have very little movement, are shallow, relatively clear, and don’t require much strain to swim in. A pool, clear lake, or gentle river are all examples of still waters. On your turn in combat sequence, you can spend 2 AP to swim 5 feet across still waters. 

### Rushing Waters
Rushing waters are more difficult to swim through, either having lots of movement, difficult terrain, or small objects to avoid. A speedy river, moving sewage drain, or waves on the ocean are all examples of rushing waters. Rushing waters always push you in a direction determined by the GM, at the start of your turn while you swim in rushing waters, you move 10 feet in the direction of the water. On your turn in combat sequence, you can spend 2 AP to swim 5 feet across rushing waters. 

### Treacherous Waters
Treacherous waters are extremely difficult to swim through, their waters have a force that is near impossible to swim in without assistance. Riptides, rapids, or a stormy sea are all examples of treacherous waters. Treacherous waters always push you in a direction determined by the GM, at the start of your turn while you swim in rushing waters, you move 20 feet in the direction of the water. On your turn in combat sequence, you can spend 3 AP to swim 5 feet across rushing waters. You have a limit to how many rounds you can continue to swim in treacherous waters. You can continue swimming on each of your turns for a number of rounds equal to your Endurance ability score (to a minimum of one round). At the start of your next turn after swimming past your limit, you begin to drown ([[Suffocating]]) 

## Jumping 

### Long Jump
You can jump a number of feet equal to 5 x your Strength modifier (minimum of 5 feet) so long as the last two action points you used were to move (note: You could have used these two action points on your last turn, with a readied action, or with the commander perk). If you don’t move, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, every 5 feet you clear on the jump costs 1 AP. If you do not have enough AP to clear the jump, you cannot jump on this turn. 

You can optionally attempt to jump further than your limit. You must first spend the amount of AP it would take to clear the jump. Then you must succeed a Strength ability check with the DC equal to 10 + the extra number of feet you are attempting to clear. On a success you clear the distance. On a failure, you do not clear the distance and you still use the AP it would have taken to clear the distance. 

### High Jump
You can jump a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier (minimum of 1 feet) so long as the last two action points you used were to move (note: You could have used these two action points on your last turn, with a readied action, or with the commander perk). If you don’t move, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, every foot you clear on the jump costs 1 AP. If you do not have enough AP to clear the jump, you cannot jump on this turn. 

You can optionally attempt to jump higher than your limit. You must first spend the amount of AP it would take to clear the jump. Then you must succeed and Strength ability check with the DC equal to 18 + the extra number of 123 feet you are attempting to clear. On a success you clear the distance. On a failure, you do not clear the distance and you still use the AP it would have taken to clear the distance. 

## Sprinting

During combat, movement is a vague representation of how your character maneuvers through dangerous situations. It is often assumed your character is planning their movement while being cautious and swift, but speed is not prioritized. However, you can prioritize speed in circumstances that require it. You can spend 5 AP to immediately move 50 feet in a straight line. If you stop or are obstructed by difficult terrain before you finish this movement, your movement ends.
