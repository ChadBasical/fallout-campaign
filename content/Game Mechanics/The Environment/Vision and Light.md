A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. 

In a **lightly obscured** area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Perception checks that rely on sight, their passive sense is reduced by 5, and their range with all ranged weapons is halved. 

A **heavily obscured** area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see page #) when trying to see something in that area.

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.

**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do flashlights, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius. 

**Dim light** creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light. 

**Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit cave or a powered down vault. 

## Blindsight

A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses have this sense. 

## Nightvision
Within a specified range, a creature with nightvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
