Ever since the bombs fell the wasteland has been covered in Radiation. Radiation is a senseless, invisible poison that degredates living cells into chemical soup. Though radiation occasionally takes on strange and even mystical properties at times. 

The GM decides the severity of Radiation in an area using the Radiation Severity Score table. If a character possesses a geiger counter or pip-boy, the GM informs the character on the Radiation Severity Score. 

## Radiation DC
(These rules are written under the Endurance section of Ability Scores and Skills, but are repeated here for convenience.) If your chosen race is Human, then you have a Radiation DC. Your Radiation DC is equal to 12 - your Endurance ability modifier. Radiation DC is a measurement of how much you can resist radiation before taking levels of . Whenever your character enters or starts their turn for the first time in an Irradiated Zone you must roll a d20 roll against your Radiation DC. If you fail, you take 1 level of radiation (see page 108). If you succeed, your Radiation DC increases by 2 until you remove all your levels of Rads. All Irradiated Zones have a Radiation Severity Score that determines how often you must roll a d20 against your Radiation DC. Some Irradiated Zones are less dangerous than others and you may only roll every hour, some are more severe and you may roll every minute to every round. Unlike other checks, instead of adding any ability modifiers, your Endurance modifier is subtracted from your Radiation DC. Other items, equipment, and perks in the game can reduce your Radiation DC.
