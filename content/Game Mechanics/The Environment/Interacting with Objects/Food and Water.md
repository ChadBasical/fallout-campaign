Food and Water Characters who donâ€™t eat or drink suffer the effects of starvation or dehydration (see page 111). The amount of food and water your character needs is detailed in their [[Races]].

If your character is a ghoul or human, or super mutant: 
- You take a level of [[Hunger]] every 24 hours without food. 
- You take three levels of [[Dehydration]] every 24 hours without water
