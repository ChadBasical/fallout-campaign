When a character rests, they choose how long they will rest. Resting does not have to be sleep, but could be light activity, downtime, or any light activity. The amount of sleep you require each day and how many stamina points and hit points you heal from resting is different depending on your character’s race. 

### Ghoul, Human, and Super Mutant Rest 
If your character is a ghoul, human, or super mutant: 
- You take a level of exhaustion every 24 hours without sleep. 
- 1 hour of rest restores your stamina points to half your maximum. Sleeping comfortably restores your stamina points to full. 
- 6 hours of rest restores a number of HP equal to half your Endurance ability score + your level and removes one level of exhaustion. 

### Gen-2 Synth and Robot Rest
If your character is a gen-2 synth or robot: 
- You do not require sleep. 
- 1 hour of rest restores your stamina points to full. 
- 2 hours of rest restores a number of hit points equal to half your INT or PER score + your level and removes one level of exhaustion.

## Sleeping Comfortably

You can sleep anywhere you want, however, some characters won’t feel as refreshed when sleeping in rain, cold, extreme heat, or other rough circumstances. If you do not sleep comfortably, you regain half as much SP and HP as you normally would. A soft surface (such as a blanket or bedroll) along with shelter (such as a cave, building, or tent) allow any character to sleep comfortably.
