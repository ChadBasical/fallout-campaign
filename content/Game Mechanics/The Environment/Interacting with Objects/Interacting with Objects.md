A characterâ€™s interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens. 

For example, a character might decide to pull a switch, which might, in turn, open a door, cause a room to flood with water, or turn on a power grid that causes waves of robots to attack anything that moves in the area until every living thing is reduced to burnt plasma. If the switch is broken, though, a character might need to force it or fix it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place or an Intelligence check to rewire the switch. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.
