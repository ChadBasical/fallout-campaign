When a flammable object is lit aflame via a flamer, incendiary grenade, or a rogue flare; fires begin to spread. When an area is engulfed in flames, any creature who moves through the area or starts their turn in the area takes 2d10 fire damage and gains Burning. At the start of each round, the flaming area spreads 5 feet in all directions, increasing the size of the area. The spread of the flames is up to GMâ€™s discretion. There are factors that could allow flames to spread slower, such as winds, rain, or if the flames are surrounded by non-flammable objects. These flames can last upwards to a few hours unless put out via water, weapons that deal cryo damage, or a fire extinguisher. 

The larger a flaming area gets, the more damage it deals. For every 20 additional feet a flaming area grows, its damage is increased by 1d10 to a maximum of 50d10.
