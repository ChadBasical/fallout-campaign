Requirements: Strength 10

You can use other creatures as improved weapons. If they are unwilling, you must succeed a grapple check to use them as an improvised weapon. Using a creature as an improved weapon costs 6 AP, uses your Melee Weapons skill to hit, critically hits on 20 (x2), and deals a number of d6â€™s of impact damage depending on their size. Small creatures deal 3d6 impact damage, medium creatures deal 4d6 impact damage, and large creatures deal 5d6 impact damage (you cannot use a creature huge or greater as an improvised weapon). You can also throw them a number of feet equal to 2 x your Strength score. If you throw a creature into another creature and deal impact damage to their hit points, they both fall prone. Whenever a creature is used as an improved weapon, they take half of the impact damage dealt to their hit points.
