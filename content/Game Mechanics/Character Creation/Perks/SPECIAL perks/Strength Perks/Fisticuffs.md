Requirements: Strength 5

Give ‘em the one-two! Whenever you roll damage from an attack roll made with an unarmed attack and the damage is dealt to a target’s stamina points, add 3 to the result. Additionally, if you make a targeted attack with an unarmed attack to a creature's head and deal more than their level in points of damage to the creature's hit points, they become dazed for a number of rounds equal to their 8 - their Endurance ability score (minimum of 1).
