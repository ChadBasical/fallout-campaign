Requirements: Luck 7

Whenever you roll a critical hit, you can choose to deal no extra damage. If you do, you gain a temporary karma cap that you lose when flipped. If you use this temporary karma cap on an attack roll, the attack is automatically a critical hit. You can only have a maximum of one temporary karma cap.
