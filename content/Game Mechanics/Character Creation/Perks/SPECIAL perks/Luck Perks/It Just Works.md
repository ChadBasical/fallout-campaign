Requirements: Luck 5

Whenever any of your weapons or armor would gain a level of decay, roll a Luck check with the DC equal to 12 + the current levels of decay on the weapon or armor. If you fail, the weapon or armor gains a level of decay. If you succeed the weapon or armor still gains a level of decay, but this level of decay doesnâ€™t apply any negative effects for as long as you have it. Repeat: You can take this perk up to a maximum of twice, if you take it again; whenever you succeed the aforementioned Luck check, the weapon or armor gains no levels of decay instead.
