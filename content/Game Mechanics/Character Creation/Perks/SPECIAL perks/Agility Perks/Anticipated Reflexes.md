Requirements: Agility 10

Whenever an attack beats your AC and hits you, you can choose to spend 3 Action Points to increase your AC by 1, 6 Action Points to increase your AC by 2, or 9 Action Points to increase your AC by 3. However, at the start of your next turn you will regain less Action Points equal to the amount you spent.
