Requirements: Agility 6.

Whenever you hit a creature with a ranged attack, your next ranged attack roll is increased by 2 so long as you target a different creature. After this second attack, if you target a different creature than the previous two attacks, the attack roll is increased by 4. After this third attack, you cannot gain the initial increase of 2 until you make another ranged attack. 

Clarification: You can make one normal ranged attack, then if you target another creature, you get +2. If you target another different creature, you get +4. Then, the bonus resets. You need to attack a creature without this perkâ€™s bonus to start the +2 to +4 cycle again. Further clarification, you do not need to make these attacks all on one turn.
