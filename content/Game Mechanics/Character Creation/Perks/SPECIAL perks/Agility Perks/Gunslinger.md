Requirements: Agility 6

Whenever you make an attack roll with a handgun, add 2 to the result. Additionally, whenever you hit a creature with a targeted attack roll to the head with a handgun, you can flip one of your Karma Caps to turn the hit into a critical hit. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you roll combat sequence again.
