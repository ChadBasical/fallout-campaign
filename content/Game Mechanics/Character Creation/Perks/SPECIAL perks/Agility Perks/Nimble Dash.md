Requirements: Agility 5

Whenever you spend action points on your turn to sprint, you do not stop your movement when small barriers block you. Instead you can spend 10 feet of that movement to vault over or slide under the barrier. Additionally, if you spent all of your action points on a turn to sprint, all attack rolls made against you have disadvantage until the start of your next turn.
