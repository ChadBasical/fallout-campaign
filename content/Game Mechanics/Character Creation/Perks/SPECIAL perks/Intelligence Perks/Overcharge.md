Requirements: Intelligence 10

When you spend action points to make an attack roll with a ranged weapon, you can spend up to 3 additional AP to add a number of additional damage dice to the damage. The number of additional damage dice that are added is equal to the amount of extra AP spent. You can only use this ability once per turn.
