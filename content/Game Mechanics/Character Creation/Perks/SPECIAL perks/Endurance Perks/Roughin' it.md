Requirements: Endurance 7

You're more at home under the open stars than under a roof. Whenever you rest outside for at least 1 hour, you gain temporary hit points and temporary stamina points equal to your level for the next 8 hours. Repeat: You can take this perk up to a maximum of twice. When you take it again, each other creature of your choice who also rests with you gains the same bonus.
