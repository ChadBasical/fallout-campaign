Requirements: Charisma 6

The power of your personality inspires die-hard loyalty from your followers. When you first take damage to your hit points, your party members can regain all their stamina points so long as they can sense you. Once this ability triggers it doesnâ€™t trigger again until you rest for at least 8 hours. Repeat: Once a player character has taken this perk, it cannot be taken by any other characters.
