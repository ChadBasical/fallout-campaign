Requirements: Perception 6

When you're deep in enemy territory, you just start chucking grenades and hope for the best. Whenever you attack with a weapon or equipment that has an area of effect, the area is increased by half. Repeat: If you take this perk again, area of effect size is increased by half (effectively doubling your area of effect size).
