A perk represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. Some of these abilities defy natural laws and basic physics, but there are far more unexplainable phenomena in the wasteland. Whenever you gain a Perk you immediately gain its abilities. 

**Requirement**
If a perk has a requirement you must meet the requirement before you take the perk. 

**Repeat**
Some perks have a Repeat section that allows you to gain the benefits of a perk you have previously chosen. The repeat section specifies how many different times you can take the perk, and if there are any requirements to doing so. Otherwise, unless specified, you cannot gain the benefits of a perk you have previously gained.
