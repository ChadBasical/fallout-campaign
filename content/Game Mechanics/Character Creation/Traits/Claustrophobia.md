You have a fear of enclosed spaces. The effects from your Party Nerve are doubled while you are outside (IE: whenever you roll combat sequence and gain temporary stamina points, you gain double the amount and whenever you roll a death save, you double your party nerve bonus.) However, you do not gain the benefits of your Party Nerve while indoors, underground, or otherwise not outside. 

Wild Wasteland, true to the original: You gain advantage on all ability and skill checks while outside, but disadvantage on all ability and skill checks while indoors, underground, or otherwise not outside.
