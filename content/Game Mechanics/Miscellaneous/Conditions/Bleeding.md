At the start of each of their turns, for each level of bleeding they have, a creature with this condition takes damage to their hit points equal to half their healing rate (rounded down). A dying creature with any levels of this condition fails a death save at the start of their turns. If a creature who has any levels of bleeding is healed, they do not gain any hit points, instead they remove two levels of bleeding.
