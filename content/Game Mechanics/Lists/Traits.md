Traits are special abilities that modify your character in a positive way and a negative way. Traits are completely optional and are only to provide additional customization and flavor to your character. At 1st level you can choose 1 trait from the Character Traits list. Your Background also provides you with an optional trait, found under the Background Traits list.

**Wild Wasteland**
Some traits can be modified by this optional rule that doubles all the numerical values for both benefits and negatives for each trait, or grants entirely new abilities. For the truly high risk-high reward players, you can opt to “Wild Wasteland” your chosen trait(s). If you do, modify your trait with the Wild Wasteland section at the end of each trait.
