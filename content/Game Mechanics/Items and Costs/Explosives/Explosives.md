From molotov cocktails, frag grenades, or dynamite. Explosives cause massive damage in a large area, often unpredictable and highly dangerous. Those trained in Explosives should be the only ones handling such destructive weapons, but the wasteland makes one especially desperate for power. Attacking. Instead of making an attack roll, explosives deal damage to every creature and object in its radius that isn’t behind full cover when it detonates. When you use your AP to arm and throw an explosive, roll a d20 and add your explosives skill bonus. Consult the table below for the result of the roll.

| 1    | The explosive detonates immediately before you throw it.                                |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2-3  | The explosive is thrown half the distance and detonates at the start of your next turn. |
| 4-14 | The explosive detonates at the start of your next turn.                                 |
| 15+  | The explosive detonates at the end of your turn.                                        |

## Action Points
(Abbreviated to AP) How many action points you must spend on your turn to arm and throw the explosive. Explosives with fewer action points are often lighter and quicker to arm. 

## Arming a Placed Explosive
When you use AP to arm a placed explosive, you must succeed an explosives skill check equal to 10 + the bonus noted in the Arm DC column. If your explosives skill bonus is equal to or greater than the noted bonus, you automatically succeed. If you fail, the explosive detonates immediately. If you succeed, the explosive is armed. 

## Damage
Creatures and objects within a detonated explosive’s area of effect that aren’t behind full cover take damage equal to listed in the damage column. 

## Early Detonation
If an explosive takes at least 1 point of ballistic, explosive, fire, laser, or plasma damage; it detonates. The AC of an explosive is always 18. Explosives do not detonate if they are worn or carried by a creature unless the explosive is targeted by an attack roll. 

## Throwback
If an explosive has been armed, but hasn’t detonated yet. You can spend 4 AP to throw it. Roll a d20 and add your explosives skill bonus to the roll. If the result is a 12 or below, the explosive detonates immediately before you throw it. If the result is above an 13, the explosive detonates at the end of your turn. 

## Disarming
Any explosive with the timed property can attempt to be disarmed after it has been armed. To disarm, you must spend 6 AP on your turn, be within 5 feet of the explosive, and succeed an explosives skill check equal to 10 + the timed bonus listed in the special properties column. If you fail, the explosive detonates at its normal time. If you fail by 5 or more, the explosive detonates immediately. If you succeed, the explosive is disarmed. 

## Range
An explosive can be thrown a number of feet equal to your Strength ability modifier multiplied by the number listed in the range column. 

## Area of Effect
The area of effect column lists two numbers that detail the radius and damage of each explosive. Each creature and object in the radius of the first range that isn’t behind full cover takes full damage, while each creature and object in the radius of the second range that isn’t behind full cover takes half as much damage. If an explosive only has one number listed, each creature an object in the radius takes full damage. (Example, a Dynamite had an area of effect of 5ft / 20ft. Each creature within 5 feet of the explosion takes full damage, while each creature within 20 feet of the explosion takes half as much damage.) 

## Carry Load
A representation of how heavy the explosive is and how much space it takes up. 

## Special Properties
Some explosives weapons have special abilities or conditions that apply when they detonate or when you throw them. Each one varies and should be read before throwing the explosive. Some have keywords which are detailed below under Explosive Special Properties.
