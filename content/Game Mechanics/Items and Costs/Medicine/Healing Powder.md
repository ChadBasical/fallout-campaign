You can spend 6 AP to use this medicinal item on yourself or another creature so long as they are next to you. If that creature is a human, mutant, abomination, animal, or insect; at the start of each of their turns they heal a number of hit points equal to half their healing rate (rounded down). After healing for three rounds, the effects cease. Ghouls, robots, and gen-2 synths are unaffected by healing powder
