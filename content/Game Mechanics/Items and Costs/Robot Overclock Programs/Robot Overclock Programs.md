These disks, drives, and various technological devices are loaded with a program that runs a set of code to bypass certain capabilities in a robot or gen-2 synth, similar to that of a virus but functioning on more capable and intelligent machines that can, in turn; enhance the machine. Functioning near identical to chems in humans, ghouls, and super mutants. 

## Usage
You can use a program with 4 AP. 

## RAM Limit
Using too many programs in a short period of time can result in lag and overheating when your random-access memory isn’t large enough. Your RAM limit is equal to 2 plus half of your Endurance modifier (rounded down) (minimum of 1, maximum of 4). For each program that you use beyond your limit within a day, you gain 5 levels of exhaustion. 

## Duration
All program effects last for 1 hour. 

## Truncated Bytes and Faulty Programming
Every program has this property. If you use a program you must succeed an Endurance ability check equal to 6. If you fail, your system becomes more attuned to functioning with the program rather than without and thus; your programming becomes faulty. While your programming is faulty, and you are not under the program’s effects, you gain the associated effect listed below. Your programming becomes no longer faulty if you use 5 circuitry junk items and make a crafting skill check with the DC equal to 20. On a failure, you lose the circuitry and your programming is still faulty.
