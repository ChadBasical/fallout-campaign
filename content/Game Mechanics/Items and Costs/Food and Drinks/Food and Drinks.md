Some of the most important things that almost everyone needs in the wasteland. Folks have found new ways to prepare and consume food and drinks. Pre-made food is among the large quantities of canned or otherwise preserved food that last beyond the war. Cooked food has been prepared much more recently. Some drinks have been bottled since before the war and still taste fresh. 

## Consumption

If youâ€™re someone who needs to consume food and drink to survive, whenever you consume any food you remove one level of hunger and whenever you consume any drink, you remove one level of dehydration. You do not gain the benefits or the effects of any foods until after 1 minute. However, you gain the benefits and effects of drinks immediately after you consume them.
