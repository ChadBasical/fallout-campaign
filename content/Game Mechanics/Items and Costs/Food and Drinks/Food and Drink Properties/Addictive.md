 If you consume a drink with the Alcoholic property that also has this property, you must succeed an Endurance ability check equal to 5. If you fail, you become addicted to alcoholic drinks. While you are addicted to alcoholic drinks you always have two levels of exhaustion unless you are drunk. You lose your alcohol addiction if you spend a number of weeks equal to 6 minus your Endurance ability ability modifier (minimum 1).
