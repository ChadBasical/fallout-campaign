## Drinks
Each drink listed in this table is a representation of 8 oz of that drink unless otherwise specified. (For example, if a character wanted to purchase a 36 oz bottle of Rum, it would cost them 125c and have five total drinks from it.) Every 8 oz of a drink is equal to 2 load. All drinks remove one level of dehydration.
