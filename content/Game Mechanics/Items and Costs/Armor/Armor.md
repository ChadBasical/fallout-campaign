Due to the vastness of what could be considered armor, you have the option to wear just about anything and select the type of armor your vestments fall under. Use the descriptions and table below to decide what kind of armor you have.

Cloth
Cloth armor doesn’t provide much protection. However it lends its simplicity to being light and having the most amount of upgrade slots. Most vault suits are considered cloth armor. 

Leather
A jacket, fittings around the arms, knee pads, and boots all fall under leather armor. Leather isn’t very tough but can fit easily around one’s body. 

Metal
In the wasteland, you take what you can get. Metal armor is a combination of various pieces that have been welded or fitted around the body. Granting toughness but allowing less coverage. 

Multilayered
A combination of vestments. Layers of leather, cloth, tarp, metal, anything lying around to act as armor is considered multilayered. This armor provides maximum coverage but sacrifices toughness. 

Ballistic Weave
Bulletproof vests, kevlar, or military grade jackets. Ballistic weave is a pre-war synthetic fiber whose reproduction has been lost with the war. Extremely rare but provides the best of all armor aspects; coverage, toughness, and weight. 

Steel
Fitted plates of metal that cover the body like a knight provide a modern solution in the apocalypse for dealing with threats. steel maximizes coverage and toughness so long as you have the strength. 

Armor Class
A representation of how tough your armor is. Abbreviated to AC, while you wear armor your AC is equal to the number listed. Otherwise, your AC is 10 and cannot be lower than 10 unless another ability specifies. If an attack roll’s total is equal to or greater than your AC, you take damage. Armor with higher AC’s is made of stronger materials that completely protect you, though cover less of your body. 

Damage Threshold
The measurement of how much the armor protects you. Whenever you take damage to your hit points, the damage is reduced by a number equal to your DT. Armor with higher DT covers more of your body, protecting you from all attacks. Your DT can never be lower than 0. 

Carry Load and Strength Requirement
A representation of how heavy the armor is, and how much space it takes up. If you are wearing the armor, its load is halved. If you are wearing armor that you do not meet the Strength requirement for, you are slowed. Upgrade Slots. Armor can be customized with upgrades. The number of upgrades it can have is listed in the table below. Armor upgrades cannot be attached to all pieces of armor unless otherwise specified. (Example: a leather armor upgrade cannot be attached to steel armor) Additionally, ranks in an upgrade do not count against the armor’s slot total.

## Upgrades 

Upgrades can be crafted or purchased from certain vendors. When you have an armor upgrade you can spend 1 minute to attach it to your armor, or spend 1 minute to remove it. You can only have one type of armor upgrade on each set of armor. When you craft or purchase an armor upgrade you cannot attach it to another set of armor unless it is of the same material unless otherwise specified. 

### Ranks

You can either craft or purchase a rank to your upgrade which improves it. Each rank costs the base price of the upgrade. Each rank grants a new ability which adds on to the previous one. (Example: If you have a Rank 3 upgrade, it has the abilities of Rank 1, 2, and 3.) You cannot have a rank in an upgrade without first either purchasing or crafting the previous rank
