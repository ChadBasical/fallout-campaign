Power Armor is heavy duty, hydraulically engineered, full body armor. Power Armor operates as an extremely complicated piece of machinery that opens from the back, allowing its operator to step inside and become enveloped by the thick metal plating, acting as a pilot to a tank-like suit. Adding about a foot to their height, and extending their limbs by about half a foot. Even the lower end models of Power Armor provide immense protection and power to its wearer. 

Operating Power Armor provides a list of benefits and can fundamentally change how your character operates, fights, and interacts with the world. The following abilities detail your benefits and requirements while operating any suit of Power Armor. 

## Operation
It costs 6 AP on your turn to enter or exit Power Armor. 

## Defense Points
When you enter Power Armor you gain a new set of points called defense points (abbreviated to DP). Defense points operate similarly to stamina points; whenever you take damage you may subtract the damage from your defense points instead of your hit points or stamina points. However, defense points are not modified by any ability scores, instead the total you gain is a flat amount described in the Power Armor table below. If you exit Power Armor, you no longer have defense points. If any creature enters the armor, they gain defense points equal to the amount that previous user had when they exited. When your defense points hit 0, the Power Armor gains a level of decay and you regain defense points equal to its total. If the Power Armor has 10 levels of decay, you no longer regain defense points.(Example: You have 15 DP. You take 20 damage. Your DP falls to 0, and the Power Armor gains a level of decay, you gain 15 more DP, and subtract the remaining 5 for a total of 10 DP.) 

## Hydraulic Machine
Your Strength ability score is considered a 10 and your size is Large. 

## Extended Limbs
When you attack with a melee weapon, the range is increased by 5 feet. If you spend at least 6 AP to move on a turn, you can move an additional 15 feet. Additionally, if you sprint in Power Armor, you move double the distance. 

## Calibrated Impact Servos
Standing up from prone only costs 1 AP and if you are subjected to an effect that would push you back or pull you, you move half the distance you normally would. Additionally, you are resistant to impact damage. (Impact damage is any damage you would take from falling, being thrown, or something heavy falling on you.) 

## Automatic Injector
You can use a chem or stimpak without spending any AP. 

## Lead Plated Exoskeleton
You do not suffer any limb conditions and your limbs cannot be severed. Additionally, you are immune to Radiation. 

## Oxygen Tank
You can breathe underwater, however you cannot swim and you sink at a rate of 100 feet each round. 

## Upgrade Slots
Power Armor can be upgraded just like regular armor. The number of upgrades it can have is listed in the table below. (For more details on upgrades, see Power Armor Upgrades below). Unlike regular armor, Power Armor upgrades can be attached to all pieces of armor unless otherwise specified. 

## Repair
Unlike other weapons and armor, levels of decay do not apply any negative effects to the armor or user (besides a loss in defense points) and Power Armor does not cease to function when it reaches 10 levels of decay. To repair any levels of decay from Power Armor, you must; spend at least 15 minutes per level of decay you attempt to repair, have the materials (5 steel, 3 circuitry, 3 aluminum, and 3 adhesive), and roll a successful Crafting check against the DC listed in the Repair section. 

## Carry Load and Strength Requirement
All Power Armor has a load of 100. If you are wearing the Power Armor, its load is equal to 0, Power Armor has no Strength Requirement as its interior chassis supports its user entirely. Even if you are missing limbs, you can still use Power Armor. 

## Fusion Core
Power Armor requires a special type of condensed nuclear power called a Fusion Core to operate. It slots into its back and provides an allotted time of operation. You can spend 5 AP on your turn to replace the Fusion Core on a set of Power Armor. Once the allotted time is up, the Power Armor pulls power from its emergency reserves granting it a minute of operation. After the minute is up, the power armor uses its last amount of power to open its back to allow its user to exit the armor. Then, it ceases function. If necessary, you can choose to override this function to keep yourself in the power armor. However, while in this state you are grappled and restrained and you cannot escape unless your Strength score is equal to 20. Escaping in this way decays the Power Armor by 10 levels. 

## Fusion Core Targeting
Unfortunately, Power Armor has one weakness; its fusion core is exposed to allow itself to cool. Any creature who can see the back of another creature that wears power armor can make a targeted attack against it. To make this targeted attack you must spend an additional 5 AP and the attack deals no damage to the armor or its operator and applies no condition. But, each time the fusion core has taken at least 30 damage; it becomes overheated until the start of its operator's next turn (see Overheating below). 

## Overheating
If you spend more than 15 AP on a turn while you wear Power Armor, it overheats until the end of your next turn. When Power Armor first becomes overheated, or is overheated at the start of your turn; the armor must spend additional energy to cool itself and the fusion core, draining its energy significantly, losing 30 minutes of its allotted time. If a fusion core only has 30 minutes of its allotted time, and becomes overheated, the Power Armor ejects the user and ceases function. You can choose to override the automatic cooling so as to not lose any allotted time. However, if you do, the fusion core explodes at the end of your next turn. This explosion has a small radius of 20 feet and a large radius of 50 feet. All creatures and objects in the short radius take 20d10 explosive damage, or half as much in the large radius. The Power Armor is destroyed, and if its user was still inside; they incinerate into carbon. Additionally, the area of the explosion becomes a Level 5 Irradiated Zone, decreasing in its level by 1 every 24 hours.
