Chem (a truncation of "chemical") is a slang term for a drug. A chem is any chemical or medicine that is used to cause changes in a person's behavior or biological systems. Chems provide you with buffing effects that will grant your character power in combat or other scenarios, at the cost of being highly addictive. 

## Usage
You can use a chem with 4 AP. 

## Chem Limit
Using too many chems in a short period of time can result in overdosing. Your chem limit is equal to 2 plus half of your Endurance modifier (rounded down) (minimum of 1, maximum of 4). For each Chem that you use beyond your limit within a day, you gain 5 levels of exhaustion. 

## Duration
All chem effects last for 1 hour. 

## Addiction and Side Effects
Every chem has this property. If you use a chem you must succeed an Endurance ability check equal to 6. If you fail, you become addicted to the chem. While you are addicted to the chem, and not under the chemâ€™s effects, you gain the associated effect listed below. You lose your chem addiction if you spend a number of weeks equal to 6 minus your Endurance ability ability modifier (minimum 1).
