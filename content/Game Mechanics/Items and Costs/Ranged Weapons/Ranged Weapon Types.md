**Handguns**
The trusty sidearm. Pistols, Revolvers, or hand cannons are types of Handguns. These weapons are light and accessible and don’t require two hands to operate. They don’t pack as much of a punch, or have extensive capability; but their simplicity lends to the user. Plus they come cheap and easy to manufacture. 

**Submachine Guns**
Compact and ready to spray lead with reckless abandon. Most smaller automatic weapons are categorized under Submachine Guns, or SMGs for short. These weapons fire lots of rounds quickly to dispatch enemies. Trading range and stability for speed. 

**Rifles**
From assault rifles to trail carbines, Rifles are highly precise and customizable. Useful for their range and precision, but lacking in speed. Most Rifles are large and require some Strength to use properly. 

**Shotguns**
The blast from a shotgun is heard all too often in the wasteland. Simple weapons used for dispatching enemies quickly, renown for destructive power. Range isn’t on the side of a shotgun, neither is speed, nor precision. All of which trades for sheer damage. 

**Big Guns**
Need something really dead? Rocket Launchers, Miniguns, and the renowned Fat Man are all considered Big Guns. These weapons have immense destructive power which are made for taking down scores of enemies at once. Though, they are a rarity to be found in the wasteland and their ammo is often scarce. However, if you have the capability to wield such a weapon; your enemies stand little chance. 

**Energy Weapons**
Highly technical equipment utilizing scientific methods of empowered elements rather than blasting small pieces of metal out of a cannon. In other words, laser guns. Most energy weapons aren’t built like a typical gun and operate more like a tool rather than a firearm. Laser weapons have no recoil and only require you aim the laser blast in the direction of your target, which could potentially cause them to burst into flame. Plasma weapons fire a superheated green ball of energy that travel nearly ten times slower than a bullet, melting targets in its path. While Gauss weapons have magnetic coils mounted into the weapon that launch projectiles forward. These weapons special properties change much of how a ranged weapon is used, be sure to examine each one.
