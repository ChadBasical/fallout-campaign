Listed below are the different types of ammunition and their details. 

**Cost**
In the table below, the cost section lists the price for a single round of ammunition. Under each round type on the special ammunition tables, a modifier is listed. This modifier modifies the base ammunition cost and determines the cost of a single special ammunition.

**Load**
While every ammunition has a different size and weight, while organized together they can become less cumbersome. Any ten individual ammunitions are equal to 1 load. 

**Special Ammunition**
There are certain kinds of ammunition that can be found or crafted in the wasteland. If your weapon meets the requirement, you can load the special ammunition into your weapon to apply a special property to the attack. When the special ammunition rounds are all used, the weapon loses those properties

**Gun Ammunition

| Type          | Cost | Type              | Cost |
| ------------- | ---- | ----------------- | ---- |
| .308          | 10c  | 12.7 mm           | 12c  |
| .50           | 20c  | 20 gague          | 2c   |

| 12 gague      | 5c   | Railway Spike     | 5c   |
**Energy Ammunition**

Energy weapons use a unique type of ammunition akin to batteries. Instead of each round being individually loaded into a magazine or chamber, energy weapons draw power from a single cell and turn it into blasts of energy. For example, a single energy cell provides 30 rounds in a laser pistol. Meaning, to fire a laser pistol 30 times, you only require 1 energy cell. Meanwhile, a 10mm pistol can fire 12 rounds; you would need to acquire all twelve individual 10mm rounds

| Type             | Cost | Type        | Cost |
| ---------------- | ---- | ----------- | ---- |
| Cryo Cell        | 50c  | Fusion Core | 200c |
| Energy Cell      | 30c  | 2mm EC      | 40c  |
| Microfusion Cell | 35c  | Gamma cell  | 60c  |
**Heavy Ammunition**

Some weapons require unique types of ammunition that are much larger and heavier than others. These ammunition have a much higher load as a single unit rather than other types of ammunition.

| Name      | Cost | Individual Load |
| --------- | ---- | --------------- |
| Fuel      | 50c  | 20              |
| Mini Nuke | 250c | 12              |
| Missle    | 50c  | 10              |
