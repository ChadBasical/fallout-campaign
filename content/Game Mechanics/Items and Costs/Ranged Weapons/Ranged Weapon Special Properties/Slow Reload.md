 Reloading a weapon with this property costs 10 AP instead of 6. If you and another creature are within 5 feet of the weapon, you can instead spend 5 AP to reload the weapon so long as they spend 5 AP on their previous turn to help you. If your maximum AP is 9 or lower and you reload a weapon with this property and another creature is not helping you; you must spend all your AP, then you must spend any leftover AP on your next turn to reload the weapon.
