Highly technical equipment utilizing scientific methods of empowered elements rather than blasting small pieces of metal out of a cannon. In other words, laser guns. Most energy weapons arenâ€™t built like a typical gun and operate more like a tool rather than a firearm. Laser weapons have no recoil and only require you aim the laser blast in the direction of your target, which could potentially cause them to burst into flame. Plasma weapons fire a superheated green ball of energy that travel nearly ten times slower than a bullet, melting targets in its path. While Gauss weapons have magnetic coils mounted into the weapon that launch projectiles forward. These weapons special properties change much of how a ranged weapon is used, be sure to examine each one.
