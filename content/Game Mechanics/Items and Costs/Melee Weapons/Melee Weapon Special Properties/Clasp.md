When you deal damage to a creature's hit points with a weapon that has this property, the weapon clamps onto them and renders them unable to move away from you. The creature becomes [[Grappled]] by you and any Strength or Agility ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage. If the grappled creature is one size category larger than you, they are not grappled unless your Strength ability score is equal to 10. A creature two size categories, or larger, than you cannot be grappled in this way.
