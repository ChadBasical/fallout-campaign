Each item has an associated value listed on each table below. The cost of each weapon, armor, or item is a calculation of its merit, balance, and effectiveness within the confines of the game’s rules. The weapon’s rarity, its crafting complexity, decay, or its perceived value are **not represented** in these tables. It’s important that the GM determines the final price of any weapon to a player who wishes to purchase it. You can also use these following modifiers to decrease or increase the price of an item. 

## Rarity
If the item is extremely rare to find, or the materials used to craft it are also rare, or the blueprints to craft such an item are lost; increase its cost by 250%. If the item is somewhat difficult to get ahold of or the demand for this item is extremely high, double its cost. If the merchant has only a few of the item in stock, it has sentimental value, or otherwise is a cut above the average item without being too hard to get a hold of; increase the cost by half. 

If the item is easy to find, the merchant has a surplus, or the players are trying to barter for a better price; decrease the price of the item by 25%. If the item (for some reason) is particularly bountiful in the hundreds if not thousands, has little to no value to a merchant, or is perceived as being functionally broken; decrease the price by half. 

## Decay Discount
For every level of [[Decay]] an item has, its price is decreased by 10%. This can be an easy way for more expensive items to be acquired by a wastelander that’s light in the pockets.
