Deciding to get handy? Almost anything can be crafted in the wasteland. Needing the right materials, junk, and knowhow can go a long way when you’re trying to survive.

**How to Craft** 

You can craft any item so long as you have the listed materials and your Crafting skill bonus is equal to the listed requirement. These requirements are listed on the [[Vault-Tec Item Blueprint Table]]. Additionally, you must have the suitable space and tools to craft the item. Oftentimes, locations in the wasteland will provide “Workbenches” that are stocked with the proper space and tools to craft an item, however, you may try to find, create, or jury-rig your own workbench at GM’s discretion

**Crafting Check** 
if your Crafting skill does not meet the required amount, you can instead roll a Crafting skill check with the DC equal to 10 + the item’s Crafting DC listed on the table. The result is dependent on how well you roll listed below. You can also roll a Crafting skill check even if your Crafting skill meets the required amount in an attempt to reduce less materials, however if you do; you run the risk of potentially failing to craft the item.

- *Failed* - You fail to craft the item, and you lose 1d4 of each material used (to a minimum of 1 material).
- *Failed by 8 or more* -  You fail to craft the item, and you lose 1d6 of each material used.
- *Succeeded* - You craft the item and use all the required materials.
- *Succeeded by 8 or more* - You craft the item and use 1d4 less material from one material used (to a minimum of 1 material).

**Assistance**
If another creature assists you in crafting the item you are attempting to craft, the crafting time is reduced by half for every additional creature that assists. (An item that has a crafting time of 1 hour is reduced to 30 minutes if one creature assists, and to 15 minutes if two creatures assist) However, they must also succeed in the crafting check if their crafting skill does not meet the required amount following the crafting check rules above. If they fail, the item fails to be crafted even if you or any other creatures succeed.

**Repairing Items**
You can repair one level of decay from any item so long as you succeed a crafting check, and spend the required time and materials listed in the "Vault-Tec Item Blueprint Encyclopedia” table. Each item has a repair bonus listed in the table, you must succeed a crafting skill check to repair an item. The DC is equal to 10 + the bonus listed. If your crafting skill bonus is equal to the bonus listed in the table, you automatically succeed this roll. If you fail, the item does not lose any levels of decay, you spend half as much time as you normally would, and you use half the materials (rounded down) you would have used.

**Repairing a broken Item**
To repair a broken item, you must spend the required time and resources multiplied by 5, all at the same time. Additionally, the repair bonus/DC is increased by 5. If you repair a broken item in this way, it is no longer broken and instead has five levels of decay.

**Using Another Weapon for Repair Materials**

Instead of using the required materials to repair an item, you can instead use a copy of the item or an item that has similar statistics. If you do, you repair an additional level of decay so long as the item you use for materials has 5 or less levels of decay.
